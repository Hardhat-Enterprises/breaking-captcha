<Features> This program converts sampling rates of PCM wav files. This
program also has a function to apply dither to its output and extend
perceived dynamic range.

Sampling rates of 44.1kHz and 48kHz are populary used, but the ratio
between these two frequencies is 147:160, which are not small numbers.
As a result, sampling rate conversion without degradation of sound
quality requires filter with very large order, and it is difficult to
have both quality and speed. This program quickly converts between
these sampling frequencies without audible degradation.

<Usage>

ssrc [<options>] <input wav file> <output wav file>

Usage of options are as follows :
  --rate <sampling rate>
    Specify sampling rate of output file.
  --att <value(dB)>
    Attenuate volume of output by specified value.
  --twopass
    Perform two pass processing so that clipping is avoided.
    At the first pass, the program converts sampling rate of input file and
    write to a temporary file in float numbers while scanning clippings. At
    the second pass, the program attenuate the volume so that clipping is
    prevented, and write to the output file.
  --normalize
    Normalize the wave file.
  --dither [<type>]
    Apply dithers to the output file.
    Each output sampling frequency has a different set of available noise shapers.
      0    : ATH-based noise shaping, low intensity (louder noise)
      2    : ATH-based noise shaping, medium intensity
      6    : ATH-based noise shaping, high intensity (quieter noise)
      99   : No noise shaping
      help : Show all available noise shapers
  --bits
    Specify quantization bit length. 8, 16 and 24bits are supported.
  --quiet
    Nothing is displayed except error.
  --pdf <type> [<peak>]
    Select probability distribution function and peak amplitude of noise before
    noise shaping
      type 0 : Rectangular
      type 1 : Triangular
      type 3 : Two-level (experimental)
  --profile
    Specify profile
      "standard" profile : the default setting
      "fast"     profile : faster setting
      "long"     profile : slower conversion, longer filter

  Only PCM-coded wav files are used as input and output files.
  Input and output sampling frequency must satisfy a certain condition, but
(probably) conversions between all populary used sampling frequencies are
supported.
  If sampling frequencies of input and output are same, sampling rate
conversion is not performed and only conversion of quantization bit length
with optional dithering are done.
